# Work-hour-census
In this exploratory data analysis, I focused on work hour by sex in New York City.

### Source
I used data from U.S. census.
[Aggregate Usual Hours Worked by Sex for Workers 16 to 64 Years](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B23018/)

Please see `workHour.ipynb` for more code and analysis!
